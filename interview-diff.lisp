;;; This code provides a specialized form of diff that is useful when
;;; editing transcripts of interviews. The basic idea is that we have
;;; say, an original transcript of an interview with all the text in
;;; the order it was actually said, and an edited version of the
;;; interview in which things may have been moved around. We want to
;;; be able to determine roughly what text from the original has made
;;; it into the edited version and what has been left behind. Three
;;; views are useful: 1) a list of the chunks of text from the
;;; original that do not appear in the edited version, sorted by
;;; length. 2) an HTML rendering of the original with all the text
;;; that appears in the edited version rendered distinctively from the
;;; text that does not. 3) an HTML rendering of the edited version,
;;; with any text that does not come from the original (i.e. editorial
;;; additions) rendered distinctively.

;; Maybe for section that has ties, we should remember the position in
;; edited but leave the word vectors alone. Then after we've gone
;; through all of the edited words, go back and try the remembered
;; positions again. This will deal with the case where a short phrase
;; matches a number of places and the first one happens to be the
;; wrong one. If we don't take it out, then that instance of the short
;; phrase will hopefully be taken as part of some bigger piece of text
;; used later in the edited text. As it stands now, we'll take the
;; short phrase out of the middle of the longer text which will then
;; get broken into two bits surrounding the short phrase. (Which I
;; guess will then be taken from somewhere else.)

;;; Possible variant algorithm:

;;; For each unique word in edited find all the matches in original
;;; greater or equal in length to *minimum-match*. Each match will be
;;; represented by a triple of (original-index, edited-index, length).
;;; Sort all the matches by length. Then loop through the matches,
;;; nulling out the words corresponding to the match and removing all
;;; overlapping matches 

;;; If another match overlaps the just processed match, it can be
;;; reduced. If we just removed (o, e, l) and we're reducing (o', e',
;;; l') if o < o' < o+l then part of the front of the match being
;;; reduced has been chopped off so o' and e' have to be increased and
;;; l' decreased. And if o' < o < o'+l' then l' goes to o - o' and
;;; likewise if e' < e < e'+l'. Discard matches whose length is
;;; reduced to less than *minimum-match* and resort by the new
;;; lengths.

;;; This algorithm will ensure that shorter matches don't break up
;;; longer ones. But may be more expensive. Need to figure out whether
;;; it's worth it.

  "Given word vectors `original' and `edited' return them with strings
  of words occuring in both texts replaced by nil. Thus the words that

  subsequence of the two word vectors because the strings can occur in
  different orders in the two vectors. For instance if the original
