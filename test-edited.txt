A test document. This is a paragraph that should appear in both versions.

Will be edited a little bit in the edited version.

This is a long paragraph that will be split into to two parts in the
edited version.

As it stands now it just goes on and on and on.

This is a short paragraph that will be joined with the next paragraph.
This paragraph will be joined with the previous one.

The text of this paragraph is completely new. It doesn't appear in any
form in the original document.

I like dogs a lot. Puppies are neat too. I also like cats. Kittens are
fuzzy furballs.
