A test document. This is a paragraph that should appear in both versions.

Will be slightly edited in the edited version.

This is a long paragraph that will be split into to two parts in the
edited version. As it stands now it just goes on and on and on.

This is a short paragraph that will be joined with the next paragraph.

This paragraph will be joined with the previous one.

Deletion is the fate of this block of text.

I like dogs a lot. I also like cats.

Puppies are neat too. Kittens are fuzzy furballs.
